ROMAN-NUMBER CONVERTER

##Author

## Description

The project converts user input  to Roman Number by passing it through a series of loops that checks whether it meets certain criteria
for example if the number is divisible by 1000 with no remainder, it returns C and proceeds on until the full Roman Number of the user input is found. It uses a loop to maneuver through the parameters in order to determine an output.
